# Gen Z and the Rise of Sustainable Fashion

This is a team project created for **IAT 355 – Introduction to Visual Analytics** at Simon Fraser University.

The goal of this assignment was visual storytelling. We were asked to apply data visualization concepts learned in class to a topic of our choice and use visuals to tell a clear, engaging story rather than simply present data.

## Project Overview

We chose this topic because it comes directly from our own experience as Gen Z. There is a common perception that Gen Z is only driven by trends, but we wanted to challenge that idea. As Gen Z consumers, we have seen firsthand the environmental impact of fast fashion and the growing shift toward more sustainable choices.

This project explores how sustainable fashion has moved from a niche concern to a mainstream conversation, driven largely by Gen Z culture, social media, and resale communities. The story shows how this shift appears across history, search behavior, media coverage, and real-world actions.

## What This Project Includes

The website presents a sequence of interactive visualizations that build the narrative step by step:

- A fashion history timeline showing how trends and consumption patterns have evolved  
- Google search trend data highlighting the rise of thrifting and resale platforms  
- A media timeline illustrating how sustainable fashion gained visibility through online platforms  
- TikTok hashtag data showing how Gen Z contributes to spreading sustainable fashion trends  
- A comparison of sustainable materials and their carbon impact  
- An interactive map that helps users find thrift stores near them in Canada  

Each visualization supports a specific part of the story and connects to the next to guide the viewer through the narrative.

## Tools and Technologies

- HTML, CSS, and JavaScript  
- D3.js and Vega-Lite for data visualizations  
- Leaflet for the interactive thrift map  
- Observable-inspired visualization techniques  
- GitHub Pages for deployment
