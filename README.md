# gen z and the rise of sustainable fashion

this is a team project created for **iat 355 – introduction to visual analytics** at simon fraser university.

the goal of this project was visual storytelling.
we were asked to use data visualization concepts learned in class and pick a topic, then tell a clear and meaningful story through interactive visuals.

## project idea

we chose this topic because it comes directly from our experience as gen z.
there’s a common idea that gen z only cares about trends, but we wanted to challenge that.
as gen z consumers, we’ve seen the impact of fast fashion and how sustainability has moved from a niche idea into something more mainstream.

this project tells the story of how gen z is pushing sustainable fashion through culture, media, and everyday choices, and how that shift shows up in data.

## what this project includes

the website uses multiple interactive visualizations to build the story step by step:
- a fashion history timeline showing how trends have shifted over time
- search trend data showing growing interest in thrifting and resale
- a media timeline showing how sustainability spread through platforms like youtube and tiktok
- tiktok hashtag data highlighting which sustainable trends gen z is pushing
- material and carbon footprint comparisons to show what “doing better” looks like
- an interactive map that helps users find thrift stores near them in canada

each visualization answers a specific question and connects to the next one.

## tools + technologies

- html, css, and javascript
- d3.js and vega-lite for data visualizations
- leaflet for the interactive thrift map
- observable-inspired visualization techniques
- github pages for deployment
